# All Things Config

A place to store all the helpful and secret tidbits that I'm definitely going to forget later.
Includes, but not limited to:
- vim, bash, and tmux config files
- git tricks/commands
- setup scripts
- literally anything else helpful

## Install Script
`install.sh` contains an install script to install development tools, copy over config/appearance files, and additional programs to get a new system up an running.
To run it, simply run `source install.sh`.
